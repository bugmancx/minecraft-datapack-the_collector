# the_collector

## Description

A Minecraft 1.14+ advancements datapack named "The Collector".

This datapack contains advancements after collecting every item in the game. Different advancements will appear after a player has collected all items that belong to a "collection". Each collection is a group of related items such as a collecting every sapling, every redstone item, every diamond armor type, etc.

Every item in the game belongs to one or more collections and the player will have completed all advancements after they have successfully gathered every item in the game!


## Installation Instructions

1. Copy the directory "the_collector" into your minecraft world save's "datapacks" directory.
2. Load your world and check that the datapack has loaded correctly by issuing the "/datapack list" command.
3. Check that "[file/the_collector]" is showing up in the list.

You can also upload the datapack as a zip file. Just make sure that there are no extra subdirectories before the pack.mcmeta file. (GitHub has a habit of adding this extra directory.)
